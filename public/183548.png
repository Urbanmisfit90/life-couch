It seems like you're trying to upload an image into a file path. If you want to place an image at `/C:/Users/robms/projects/life-couch/public/183548.png`, you can copy the image file you want to upload and paste it into the `public` directory of your project. Here's how you can do it:

1. Locate the image file you want to upload on your computer.
2. Navigate to the directory `/C:/Users/robms/projects/life-couch/public/` using File Explorer.
3. Paste the image file into this directory.
4. Rename the file to `183548.png` if it doesn't already have that name.

If you're working in a code editor like VS Code, you can also drag and drop the image file into the `public` folder in the file explorer panel.
